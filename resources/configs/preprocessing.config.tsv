param	value	description
runID	BRO_t1_2	String, name of the run analysis
cellranger_dir	/Users/rijndertariese/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-PrinsesMaximaCentrum/01. Research/13. Sequencing/Single cell/BRO_t1-t2/T1_2/demux_t1_1_output/T1_2_demux_seurat.rds	"string, name of directory of the cellranger run to use." 
species_mixed	FALSE	logical, is the dataset mixed species or not
species	h_sapiens	"string, allowed values are either ""h_sapiens"" or ""m_musculus"", name of species used to identify mitochrondrial and ribosomal genes"
normalization	LogNormalize	"string, allowed values are ""LogNormalize"" or ""SCTransform"", indicates which method of normalization will be used as input for downstream analysis and saved as the default assay in the Seurat object"
min_cells	3	numeric, hard minimum number of cells in which a gene must be detected
min_features	200	"numeric, hard minimum number of features which must be detected in a cell, used for initial construction of Seurat object; if a dynamic cutoff set at 2 st deviations below the mean exceeds this, it will be used to filter out additional cells"
max_mito	NA	numeric, hard max on mitochondrial content. By default, the upper threshold on mito content is the max of 5% and 2 st deviations above the mean. Setting this parameter will override the default behaviour and set a hard upper threshold on mito content.
size	100	numeric, minimum amount of cells to be present in a specific dataset	
cc_regress	TRUE	logical, regressing out cc effects or not
pcs_compute	100	numeric, number of PCs to compute and store in the seurat object
pcs_keep	30	numeric, number of PCs to use for downstream steps: tSNE, UMAP and clustering 
run_harmony	FALSE	logical, wether to run harmony integration or not
clustering_resolution	1	numeric, resolution for which the clustering solution will be saved as default in the Seurat object, used for computing per-cluster QC metrics, and used for cluster marker calling 
seed	420	numeric, random seed, set for reproducibility of results
