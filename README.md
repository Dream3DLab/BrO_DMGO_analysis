# Transcriptomic profiling of BrO, DMGO and GD2 CAR T cells

Repository accompanying the publication **De novo H3.3K27M-altered Diffuse Midline Glioma in human brainstem organoids to dissect GD2 CAR T cell function**

![](supplemental_files/graphical_abstract.jpg)


The repository is organized firstly per model and secondly per coding language

* `code/BrO/`: Code, jupyter notebooks and .Rmd files used for processing and analyzing the time course sequencing data of the Brainstem Organoid, including annotation, integration and reference mapping against the [HNOCA](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08172-8) and the [HDBCA](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adf1226).
* `code/DMGO/`: Code, jupyter notebooks and .Rmd files used for processing and analyzing de novo generated DMG tumors in BrO, including annotation and reference mapping against [Liu et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-022-01236-3) for DMG specific analysis and pan-tumor comparisons.
* `code/CART/`:

For code related to the lineage tracing data please refer to this [GitHub](https://github.com/anna-alemany/TrackerSeq_BROs)

## Data availability
Raw sequencing data is deposited at ENO (link).
Processed datasets are available through [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/15356014)
